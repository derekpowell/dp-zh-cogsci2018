Sometimes the choice was easy because of an expected or perceived inherent danger -- like the rescue dog getting burned vs a family pet getting burned. Or a soldier getting killed in Baghdad versus during a training exercise at home. In these situations, risk is calculated, expected, and accepted. It doesn't make the outcome less tragic on a human level, but less surprising on a ""news"" level.



Then there were some answers that seemed worse because they seemed like they could apply to me personally or other co-horts (like women getting raped in public) than being a soldier or crab fisherman in a specific scenario.



The old woman hurting her hip in her driveway or home perplexed me the most and was the most difficult to answer. I think falling & hurting her hip at home could potentially be worse if she lives alone. By falling in her driveway, she could at least be guaranteed someone would see her and get help.
