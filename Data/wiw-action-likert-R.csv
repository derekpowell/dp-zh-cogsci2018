For instance, due to the exchange rates, a police officer holding people hostage for $100 in Mexico is actually asking for *more money* relative to what he/she could be expected to buy than a police officer in Spain asking for the same flat amount. Likewise, a US marine accidentally shooting a comrade in a war zone is more understandable than in a training exercise (more on edge, more potential rationale for being too trigger happy).",Nope,1
