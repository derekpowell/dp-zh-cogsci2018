The first of them is entirely selfish, but I tried to answer with my gut reaction and not censor or whitewash my answer: I felt that things that seemed a little closer to affecting me were slightly worse. I.e. dysentery in  Arizona scares me slightly more than dysentery in Mexico, because I live in the United States. Ebola is worse in Egypt, which strikes me as more connected to ""western society,"" than Liberia, which seems slightly more developing. 

The second: bad things that seem more preventable are worse than ones that seem more inevitable. This cropped up a lot, but the most clear example is that a firefighter dying during a training exercise (preventable) is worse than dying while fighting a fire (less preventable). 

The third group, which is more of a grab bag, I think covers the rest of my answers: various personal biases. Best example here: house being repossessed in Florida vs Louisiana. I said it was worse in Louisiana because my first thought there is poor, black families, not given advantages in life, having their lives devastated by a storm.
